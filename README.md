# BitKrackenJS
The all new BitKracken, now uses NodeJS. ***For educational and research use only***

## How do I run this
* First, install NodeJS, then install dependencies by:
```
npm --save -i
```
* Then you have to change the *to* variable in index.js to *your* Bitcoin address.

* Then just run index.js with the node command
```
node index.js
```

Easy, right?

# Note
Stealing isn't cool. That's why this tool is ***for educational and research use only.*** Also if you want to crack BIP39, see BitKrackenJS-bip39
